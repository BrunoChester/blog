            <h1> Early days of GitHub GTM: Building a Product Qualified Lead (PQL) System.</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">
                Back in  2022/2023, I was deep into building what would become a comprehensive Product Qualified Lead system for GitHub Copilot. We started with a simple ML model to identify upsell opportunities and built from there.

            <section class="section">
                <p class="intro-text">
                    When Copilot came out it was new to the world, and our key question was: <strong>how do we systematically identify users ready to upgrade?</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p class="intro-text">
                    To answer that question we first focused on Advanced Security upsells which later became a platform for propensity modeling across the entire product portfolio.<br>The key insight: GitHub product behavior data is the strongest signal for upgrade readiness.
                    <i>Knowing which product behavior to use is the challening part and I expand more on the topic at the bottom of this article when I cover "Multi-Signal Collaboration".</i>
                </p>
                <p> For GHAS it turned out that growing teams didn't have time to ship and scan their code manually, they had to automate the process by adding Dependabot to their flow. The more dependabot, the faster their growth, and the closer they were to accept GHAS.</p>

                <h2>Definiton of PQL</h2>
                
                <p>
                    A Product Qualified Lead is a user (or group of users) who have demonstrated sustained and meaningful use of your products, and have signaled readiness to upgrade to the next best product experience.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional marketing qualified leads that rely on form fills and demographic data, PQLs are based on actual product behavior. The core insight behind product-led growth is that user acquisition, expansion, conversion, and retention should all be driven primarily by the product itself.

                <p>
                    This architectural shift from push to pull mode enabled automated distribution from Salesforce to email marketing platforms, and the product itself, with near real-time availability and consistent data across all consuming systems.
                </p>
                <p> The consistency worked for us since now we could leverage our Marketing Automation tool to nurture leads and only pass them to sales once ready. PQL started to support the Sales motion at this point and it was a huge win for us.</p>

                <h3>Adding the Orchestration Layer</h3>
                <p>
                    Coordinaition then became the major challenge with multiple systems and teams consuming PQL data. We didn't want sales calling a prospect the same day they receive a marketing email about that featue, or had a Field Eng Demo scheduled already.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The orchestration layer, a SFDC Object for Account level data broken down by Lead activity, tracked lead state across the different systems where PQLs were consumed, ensuring coordinated outreach rather than independent actions by each system or Team.<br>
                    <i>Side Note:</i> Later at Vercel, I implemented their Attribution model by GTM Motions based on the learnings ofhow fluid Teams workflows become once GTM Plays evolve.
                </p>
                <p> By now you might be thinking, well orchestration layer did what Unify or Koala do today and you would be right! But remember, this is 2022 and these tools didn't exist. We had to solve for visibility ourselves.</p>
<p> At this point, strategic aligment and processes were our top priority. We had a tiered approach to leads where Tier 1 and 2 were reserved to AEs and overall Sales team with tier 3 being allocated to Marketing and PQLs.
    <p>During this stage there is no question that <b>Process > Tech/Models</b></p>

                <h2>Model Factory: Scaling Beyond Manual Development</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Building individual models for each product doesn't scale when you have dozens of upgrade paths. We designed a "model factory" where users specify model requirements via standardized config files, and an auto-ML pipeline handles training and deployment.
                </p>

                <div class="toc">
                    <div class="toc-title">Model Factory Components Roadmap</div>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Config-driven:</strong> Standardized YAML files define model parameters</li>
                        <li><strong>Auto-ML Pipeline:</strong> Automated training and deployment</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Store:</strong> Shared feature engineering across models</li>
                        <li><strong>A/B Testing:</strong> Built-in experimentation framework</li>
                        <li><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> Performance tracking and drift detection</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This approach would trade some model performance for massive scale in model creation. Instead of hand-tuning each model, we would rapidly deploy "good enough" models for minor products and edge cases.
                </p>
                <p>Two challenges got in the way:
                <ul>
                    <ui>The tech was non existing: We used Eloqua and our Datawearehouse</ui>
                    <ul><ui> Today I would use tools like Hightouch and Inflection to accomplish the same</ui></ul>
                    <ui>The business focus changed and Microsoft asked us to focus on joining GitHub Tech Stack to the Global GTM Tech Stack at Microsoft.</ui>

                    Not every use case requires machine learning. The decision comes down to cost and volume:

                            If you have 50 enterprise customers who might upgrade to your premium security add-on, just call all of them. The cost is negligible and the personal touch adds value.

                            If you want sales to call thousands of mid-market customers about upgrading, you need a model. The volume far exceeds sales capacity, making opportunity cost significant.

                    This multi-signal approach was crucial for the Advanced Security model's success. Product usage data showed <em>what</em> customers were doing, while sales interaction history revealed <em>how</em> they responded to outreach, and support data indicated <em>where</em> they might need additional features.

                        The system ultimately became a platform for propensity modeling across the entire product portfolio. Starting with one specific use case and iterating toward a general solution worked better than trying to build the perfect system upfront.
